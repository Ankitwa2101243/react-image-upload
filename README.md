# description

This is a one-page React application that allows users to upload images, display them, and send them to a server. The application uses React hooks such as useState and useRef to manage the state and handle file input. Images can be selected from the user's device and previewed before being uploaded. The uploaded image is then sent to a backend server endpoint for further processing.
